# alexa-skills
This repository contains miscellaneous skills written for Amazon Alexa, mostly jokes for friends in my home. As such, it is unlikely that they will ever be published en masse as public skills. Feel free to download and use the skills to your heart's content. Don't forget to enter your own app id into the code.
Notable skills are a quick and dirty google search implementation and a very rude mini-chatbot invoked by saying "Alexa, tell me I'm pretty"

Be warned that some of the wording used in these skils could be considered inappropriate or offensive. In particular the Tell Me I'm Pretty skill contains a number of phrases that users at large may consider offensive. Browse/use at your own discretion.
